* org-tree-actions
A proof of concept where org buffer modifications are done in a treesitter centric way

** Usage
Run `make` to build and test (config should be agnostic)
```
make
```

This repo isn't really meant to be used in a real config. To test add it to your `runtimepath` and `require` it

```lua
vim.opt.runtimepath += <path-to-repo>
require('org-tree-actions')
```


** Supported actions
- [X] Priority Toggling
- [X] TODO State Toggleing
- [X] org-log-done
- [X] headline promotion (including subtrees)
- [ ] schedule/deadline modifications
- [ ] Property drawer modifications
